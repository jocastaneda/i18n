### How it works
The makepot file needs three things in order to create the file
* What type of project
* The path of the files
* Where to create the pot file

### Usage
Using the command line run
```
$ php makepot.php wp-theme /path/to/theme /path/to/create/pot
```
Where `$` is the directory where your WordPress install resides
